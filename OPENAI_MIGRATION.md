# OpenAI Migration Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the migration from Google Gemini AI to OpenAI's ChatGPT for the medical chatbot application.

## What Changed

### üîÑ AI Service Migration
- **From:** GeminiAIService using Google Gemini Pro API
- **To:** OpenAIService using OpenAI gpt-5 API
- **Reason:** Better performance, more reliable responses, and enhanced medical guidance capabilities

### üìÅ Files Modified

#### Core AI Service
- **`app/Services/OpenAIService.php`** - Completely rewritten with comprehensive medical prompts
  - Enhanced medical system prompts for different chat types
  - Robust error handling and fallback responses
  - Support for text and image analysis
  - Medical safety protocols and emergency detection

#### Controllers Updated
- **`app/Http/Controllers/ChatController.php`** - Already using OpenAIService
- **`app/Http/Controllers/ReportAnalyzerController.php`** - Already using OpenAIService  
- **`app/Http/Controllers/SymptomCheckerController.php`** - Enhanced with AI-powered symptom analysis
- **`app/Http/Controllers/HealthPlanController.php`** - Added AI-powered personalized health plan generation

#### Configuration Files
- **`config/services.php`** - Updated OpenAI configuration with proper model and token limits
- **`.env.example`** - Added OpenAI configuration variables

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration
Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# AI Configuration - OpenAI (ChatGPT)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=2048
```

### 2. Get OpenAI API Key
1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Generate a new API key
4. Add the key to your `.env` file

### 3. Model Selection
- **Recommended:** `gpt-5` - Latest GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- **Alternative:** `gpt-4-turbo` - Fast and capable
- **Budget option:** `gpt-3.5-turbo` - Lower cost but less capable

## üöÄ Features Enhanced

### 1. Chat Assistant
- **Three specialized modes:**
  - General Health: Wellness and lifestyle guidance
  - Symptom Discussion: Structured symptom evaluation
  - Health Advice: Evidence-based recommendations
- **Improved safety protocols** with emergency detection
- **Enhanced fallback responses** when API is unavailable

### 2. Symptom Checker
- **AI-powered analysis** replaces rule-based system
- **Comprehensive assessment** with structured output:
  - Symptom summary and possible conditions
  - Urgency classification (emergency/high/medium/low)
  - Immediate care instructions
  - Warning signs to watch for
  - Professional care recommendations

### 3. Health Plan Generator
- **Personalized AI-generated plans** based on user goals
- **Structured output** with:
  - Daily activities and habits
  - Weekly routines and planning
  - Dietary recommendations
  - Exercise schedules
  - Measurable health targets
- **Fallback to template system** if AI fails

### 4. Report Analyzer
- **Enhanced text analysis** for medical reports
- **Image analysis capabilities** using GPT-4 Vision:
  - X-rays and medical imaging
  - Blood test reports
  - General medical documents
- **Improved error handling** and medical disclaimers

## üîí Safety Features

### Medical Safety Protocols
- **No diagnostic claims** - Always recommends professional consultation
- **Emergency detection** - Identifies urgent symptoms requiring immediate care
- **Proper disclaimers** - Clear warnings about AI limitations
- **Fallback responses** - Safe responses when AI is unavailable

### Emergency Symptom Detection
The system automatically detects and prioritizes:
- Chest pain and breathing difficulties
- Stroke symptoms (face droop, speech issues, weakness)
- Severe bleeding or trauma
- Loss of consciousness
- Severe allergic reactions

## üß™ Testing the Migration

### 1. Basic Functionality Test
```bash
# Start the application
php artisan serve
```

### 2. Test Chat Assistant
1. Navigate to `/chat/new`
2. Try different chat types:
   - General health questions
   - Symptom discussions
   - Health advice requests
3. Verify AI responses are contextual and safe

### 3. Test Symptom Checker
1. Navigate to `/symptom-checker/create`
2. Enter symptoms like "headache, fever"
3. Verify AI analysis with urgency levels and recommendations

### 4. Test Health Plan Generator
1. Navigate to `/health-plans/create`
2. Select goals like "weight_loss" or "fitness"
3. Verify AI generates personalized plans

### 5. Test Report Analyzer
1. Navigate to `/reports/upload`
2. Upload a text file or medical image
3. Verify AI analysis with appropriate medical guidance

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "API key not configured" errors
- Check `.env` file has `OPENAI_API_KEY` set
- Verify API key is valid and has credits
- Run `php artisan config:clear` to refresh config

#### 2. Fallback responses appearing
- Normal behavior when API is unavailable
- Check API key validity and account credits
- Review logs in `storage/logs/laravel.log`

#### 3. Empty or malformed AI responses
- Check model name in config (should be `gpt-5` or `gpt-4-turbo`)
- Verify token limits are appropriate
- Check for rate limiting from OpenAI

### Log Monitoring
Monitor these log entries:
```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -i "openai\|ai.*error"
```

## üìä Performance Considerations

### API Costs
- **gpt-5:** ~$0.005 per 1K input tokens, ~$0.015 per 1K output tokens
- **GPT-4-turbo:** ~$0.01 per 1K input tokens, ~$0.03 per 1K output tokens
- **GPT-3.5-turbo:** ~$0.001 per 1K input tokens, ~$0.002 per 1K output tokens

### Rate Limits
- **Free tier:** 3 requests per minute
- **Paid tier:** 3,500+ requests per minute (varies by usage tier)

### Optimization Tips
1. **Cache responses** for identical queries
2. **Implement request queuing** for high traffic
3. **Use shorter prompts** when possible
4. **Monitor token usage** to control costs

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can temporarily revert:

1. **Keep GeminiAIService** - The old service is still available
2. **Update controllers** to use GeminiAIService instead of OpenAIService
3. **Restore old .env variables** for Gemini API

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Response caching** to reduce API calls
2. **User feedback system** to improve AI responses
3. **Advanced medical knowledge integration**
4. **Multi-language support**
5. **Voice interaction capabilities**
